# CopyFileTime â€“ Batch copy the Created, Last Modified and Last Accessed Time

This repo contains the (non-portable Windows) tool CopyFileTime that
lets you copy the Created, Last Modified and Last Accessed times from
the files in one directory to all the files of the same relative path in
another directory.


## Directories

This CMake project is configured to...

- create the project files in the default `out` directory
- create the binary files in a `bin` directory: `bin/<config>/<architecture>`
  - `<config>` is either `Debug` or `Release`
  - `<architecture>` is `win-x64` or `win-x86` for Windows and `linux-x64` or `linux-x86` for Linux.


## Helper Scripts

In addition to the CMake-related files, the root directory of this repo
also contains some scripts for both Windows (`.bat`) and Linux (no file
extension):

| Script  | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `build` | Create + compile the project (Release mode, both 64 and 32 bit). |
| `run`   | Run the 64-bit binary. Any call parameters of the script are used as call parameters for the binary. |
